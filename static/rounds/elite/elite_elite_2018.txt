TU12: Welcome to the first DI of the tournament. Listen carefully to the follow passage adapted
from Ovid’s Metamorphoses which I will read twice. Then act out those following lines:
Signa deus bis sex acto lustraverat anno. Quid faciat Philomela? Fugam custodia claudit,
structa rigent solido stabulorum moenia saxo, os mutum facti caret indice. Stamina
barbarica suspendit callida tela purpureasque notas filis intexuit albis, indicium sceleris.
PLAYER SHOULD DO SOMETHING ALONG THESE LINES:
The sun-god has circled the twelve signs, and a year is past. What can Philomela do?
A guard prevents her escape; the thick walls of the building are made of solid stone; her mute
mouth can yield no token of the facts. Cleverly, she fastens her thread to a barbarian’s loom, and
weaves purple designs on a white background, revealing the crime.
B1:
Now with three people, perform the following lines which will be read twice:
Perfectaque tradidit servae, utque ferat dominae, gestu rogat. Illa rogata pertulit ad
Procnen nec scit, quid tradat in illis. Evolvit vestes saevi matrona tyranni germanaeque
suae fatum miserabile legit et (mirum potuisse) silet:
PLAYERS SHOULD DO SOMETHING ALONG THESE LINES:
She entrusts it, when complete, to a servant, and asks her, by means of gestures, to take it to her
mistress. She, as she is asked, takes it to Procne, not knowing what it carries inside. The wife of
the savage king unrolls the cloth, and reads her sister’s terrible fate, and by a miracle keeps
silent.
B2:
Now listen to the following lines which will be read ONCE and have one player perform
it:
dolor ora repressit, verbaque quaerenti satis indignantia linguae defuerunt, nec flere vacat,
sed fasque nefasque confusura ruit poenaeque in imagine tota est.

Grief restrains her lips, her tongue seeking to form words adequate to her indignation, fails. She
has no time for tears, but rushes off, in a confusion of right and wrong, her mind filled with
thoughts of vengeance.

TU16: There’s nothing that encapsulates the ups and downs of romance like a good Taylor Swift
song. With that, please consider the following lines from “Blank Space”:
“​So it's gonna be forever,/Or it's gonna go down in flames/You can tell me when it’s over/If the
high was worth the pain/Got a long list of ex-lovers/They’ll tell you I’m insane/’Cause you know
I love the players/And you love the game!​”
In mythology, what couple’s love affair literally went down in flames after vengeful Greeks

Now consider the following lines from “Look What You Made Me Do”:

drama/But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma/And then the world moves on, but
one thing’s for sure/Maybe I got mine but you’ll all get yours!​”
This song captures the violent deterioration of what couple’s relationship, which resulted from
the man’s decision to marry the Corinthian princess Glauce?
JASON AND MEDEA
B2:
Finally, consider these lines from “Forever and Always”:
“​I stare at the phone, he still hasn’t called/And then you feel so low, you can’t feel nothing at
all/And you flashback to when we said forever and always/And it rains in your bedroom/
Everything is wrong/It rains when you’re here and it rains when you’re gone/’Cause I was there
when you said forever and always/You didn’t mean it, baby/When you said forever and always.​”
“Forever and always” was a lie in many mythological romances, unfortunately. However, this
was especially the case for what couple, because the man went back on his promise to return at
an appointed time and caused the woman to kill herself?

For this reason, I would never have returned, not even if you had summoned me 1,000 times by a

It is said that whilst a boy named Servius Tullius was asleep, his head was enveloped in flames,

aroused the royal family, and when one of the slaves was bringing water to quench the flames
the queen stopped him, and after calming the excitement forbade the boy to be disturbed until he
awoke of his own accord. Presently he did so, and the flames disappeared. Then Tanaquil took
her husband aside and said to him, "Do you see this boy, whom we are bringing up in such a
humble style? You may be certain that he will one day be a light to us in trouble and perplexity,

Crazed with passion, Appius tried to entice this beautiful and nubile maiden with presents and

mind to cruel and tyrannical force. He charged his client, Marcus Claudius, to claim the maid as
his slave and not to yield to those who would lay legal claim to her until the question of her free
status was decided. As Verginia was coming into the forum (there were schools in the market
area nearby), the servant of the decmvir’s lust laid his hand upon her, called her the daughter of
his own slave woman and a slave herself, and ordered her to follow him. If she hesitated, he said,

“She was the loveliest of the virgins of Thessaly, was famous for her beauty, a girl longed for in

one of your people, Achilles). Perhaps Peleus also would have tried to wed her, but he had
already taken your mother in marriage, or she was promised to your father. She would not agree
to any marriage, but (so rumour has it) she was walking along a lonely beach, and the god took
her by force. When Neptune had enjoyed his new love he said: “Make your wish, without fear of
refusal. Ask for what you most want!”
‘“This injury evokes the great desire never to be able to suffer any such again. Grant I might
not be a woman: you will have given me everything,” she said. She spoke the last words in a
deeper tone, that might have been the sound of a man’s voice. So it was: the god of the deep
ocean had already accepted her wish, and had granted, over and above it, that as a man, she
would be protected from all wounds, and never fall to the sword. He left, happy with his gifts,
and spent his time in manly pastimes, roaming the Thessalian fields.”

corpus exercēbant. Etiam tum vīta hominum sine cupiditāte agitābatur; sua cuique satis
placēbant. Postea verō quam in Asiā Cyrus, in Graeciā Lacēdaemoniī et Athēniensēs

maxumam gloriam in maxumo imperio putāre, tum dēmum perīculo atque negotiīs
