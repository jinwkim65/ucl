praecipiti saltu semet inmisit, cum vix sperare posset dimicantem se moriturum esse; quippe,
antequam adsurgeret, vivus capi poterat. Sed ita saluit ut se pedibus exciperet; et, ne circumiri
posset, fortuna providerat. Vetusta arbor ramos velut de industria regem protegentes obiecerat.

nemo tamen audebat propius accedere. Pugnabat pro rege desperatio, magnum ad honeste
moriendum incitamentum. Sed iam ingentem vim telorum exceperat, iam galeam saxa
perfregerant, iam gravata genua succiderant.
