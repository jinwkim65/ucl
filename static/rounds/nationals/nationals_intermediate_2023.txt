Dīc mihi Anglicē nōmen lūdī quem dēscrībō. In lūdō sunt duo exercitūs. Rēx
exercituī dēfendendus est, sed persōna potentissima in lūdō rēgīna est. Sunt quoque
equitēs, castella, et peditēs.
CHESS
Dīc mihi Anglicē nōmen lūdī quem dēscrībō. In lūdō, multī hominēs plūrimam
pecūniam habēre volunt. Ergō, loca emunt ac domūs et tabernās aedificant.
Nonnumquam necesse est īre in carcerem!

viā cadit, testūdō nūbem agit et auxilium fert.
