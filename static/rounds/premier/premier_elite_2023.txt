Listen carefully to the following passage, in which the Romans enter a city whose inhabitants have just
committed suicide on a mass pyre, then answer in English the question that follows.
Iam caedī perpetrātae uictōrēs Rōmānī superuēnērunt. Prīmō cōnspectū tam foedae
reī mīrābundī obstipuērunt; dein cum aurum, cumulō rērum aliārum inter ignem
fulgēns, auiditāte ingeniī hūmānī rapere uellent, correptī multī flammā sunt, cum
receptus prīmīs, urgente ā tergō ingentī turbā, nōn esset.
The question: What two reasons explain how Romans died in the fire; first why they reached into
the fire in the first place, then why they couldn’t get out?
THEY WANTED TO GRAB SOME GOLD, AND THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE BEHIND
THEM TO GET BACK OUT
B1: In honor of a Boston Elite tradition, please dramatically interpret the following passage, in which

decide how you distribute roles, but please be dramatic. I will read it out and display it on the screen.
Super cumulum rērum suārum fēminīs puerīsque cōnsīdere iussīs, ligna circā
exstruunt. Quīnquāgintā deinde iuvenibus praecipiunt ut, dōnec incertus ēventus
pugnae esset, rēs cūstōdīrent; sī urbem captum īrī vidērent, nihil hostibus
relinquerent: amīcae potius ea absūmerent manūs quam hostēs superbī.
PLAYERS SHOULD ACT OUT THE FOLLOWING:
[With the women and children ordered to sit on a pile of their possessions, they pile up logs
around them. Then they instruct 50 young men to guard the things as long as the result of
the battle was uncertain, but to leave nothing to the enemies if they see that the city is going
to be captured: ‘Let friendly hands,’ the inhabitants say, ‘destroy these things, rather than
arrogant enemies.’]
B2: Now act out the following passage about how the inhabitants of a besieged city found out about an
attempt to dig under their walls. Note that cunīculus is a tunnel, and fallō in the first sentence is used
equivalently to λανθάνω.
Cōnsul cunīculum agere īnstituit; et aliquamdiū fodientēs fefellēre hostem. Cumulus
repente terrae prope murōs ēminēns index operis oppidānīs fuit. Oppidānī,
metuentēs nē iam paene facta in urbem uia esset, fossam dūcunt ad tantam

altitūdinem, quantae esse cunīculus poterat. Deinde, silentiō factō, aure admōtā
sonitum fodientium captābant.
PLAYERS SHOULD ACT OUT THE FOLLOWING:
[The consul decided to dig a tunnel, and for a while they escaped the enemy’s notice in digging.
But the sudden appearance of a mound of earth standing tall near the walls was an indication to
the townspeople of the project. The townspeople, fearing that a way into the city had already
almost been made, dig a ditch to such a depth as the tunnel might be. Then, with silence made,
they moved their ears to the ground and listened for the sound of people digging.]
