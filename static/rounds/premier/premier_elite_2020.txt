familiar with many of the words, and you will have to rely on the endings to answer the question in Latin. Now, listen

Analogy Explanations (TU 9)​:
B1: ​Edit​ can be either indicative or subjunctive. Therefore, the change from ​edō​ to ​edit​ is either “1st person indicative → 3rd
person indicative” or “1st person indicative → 3rd person subjunctive.” Either way, ​cōnficimur​, which is 1st person (pl.), will
have to become 3rd person (pl.), and it could become either indicative or subjunctive. The passive of ​cōnficiō​ can be either
cōnficior​ or ​cōnfīō​. The combination of indicative/subjunctive and -​ficiō​/-​fīō​ yields the 4 possible forms.
B2: ​Dēfendit​ can be either 3rd sg. pres. or 3rd sg. perf. (same stem). ​Dēfendēre​ is 3rd pl. perf. (it could also be 2nd sg. fut. pass.,
but this is irrelevant since the other side of the analogy cannot be made passive). Therefore the required change is either ​(1)
“1st person → 3rd person” (no change in tense) or ​(2)​ “1st person present → 3rd person perfect.”
Vēnit​ is either ​(a) ​3rd sg. pres. of ​vēneō​ or ​(b)​ 3rd sg. perf. of ​veniō​. Following analogy ​(1)​ with parsing ​(a)​, we get ​vēneunt​ (3rd
pl. pres. of ​vēneō​). Following analogy ​(2)​ with parsing ​(a)​, we get ​vēniērunt​ or ​vēniēre​ (3rd pl. perf. of ​vēneō​). Following
analogy ​(1)​ with parsing ​(b)​, we get ​vēnērunt​ or ​venēre​ (keeping the perfect tense). Analogy ​(2)​ is harder to apply, but the most
logical conclusion is “present : perfect :: perfect : pluperfect” (going one step back into the past), which would give ​vēnerant​.
This is a little sketchy, though, which is why it’s not required in the answer line.
