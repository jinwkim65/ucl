Ultimate Certamen Library

Hello, and welcome to the UCLâ€”the Ultimate Certamen Library. The UCL is a database of past Certamen questions. It lets you search for Certamen tournaments by its name, level, and year, and also lets you search through them for keywords. 

You can also use quotation marks to search for multiple words within the same question. This feature was added to solve this issue:

\> "I'm thinking like, say I want to find questions that mention Sallust's Historiae; there's plenty of Sallust q\[uestion\]s that don't mention his Historiae and plenty of q\[uestions\]s about tacitus's Historiae. So if I search Sallust Historiae in my file browser it'll find tournaments that contain both Sallust and Historiae. But most of them won't actually have a question on Sallust's Historiae so a way to search for two words within the same question would be nice."

Here, I would search for "Sallust Historiae" to acquire the desired result.

This website is a flask program hooked up to a SQL database. Please don't hesistate to contact me (@jinwkim365@gmail.com) if you have any  tournaments you want uploaded.
